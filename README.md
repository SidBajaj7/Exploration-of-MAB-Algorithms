# 🎯 Exploration of Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms

This project explores the Multi-Armed Bandit problem with a focus on **Best Arm Identification**. We implement and compare two popular algorithms:

- **Sequential Halving (SH)**
- **Exponential-Gap Elimination (EGE)**

---

## 🧪 What We've Done So Far

- **Implemented** both SH and EGE from scratch in Python.
- **Tested** them on synthetic datasets generated using different reward distributions.
- **Evaluated** performance on metrics like accuracy, confidence, and budget usage.

---

## 🧠 Current Focus

We are now running the algorithms across **5000+ simulated cases** per scenario to assess how well they perform in different settings.

The goal is to systematically analyze their **robustness and efficiency** under various conditions.

## 📁 Structure (In Progress)

- `scripts/` → Core algorithm code  
- `notebooks/` → Exploratory runs & visualization  
- `results/` → Simulation outputs and summaries  
- `data/` → Synthetic data (if stored)

## 🚧 Work in Progress

We’ll be adding:
- Comparative graphs & stats
- Final summaries of performance

Stay Tuned!
