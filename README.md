# Exploration-of-MAB-Algorithms
This project analyzes Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms—Sequential Halving and Exponential-Gap Elimination—across 5000+ simulations in varied reward-gap scenarios. It evaluates accuracy, confidence, and cost, with clean code, results, and visual insights for best-arm identification.
